'@rainbow-me/create-rainbowkit': minor
---

RainbowKit and the [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) peer dependency have been updated to `1.x.x`, which includes [breaking changes](https://wagmi.sh/react/migration-guide#1xx-breaking-changes).

wagmi v1 now relies on `viem` instead of the `ethers` peer dependency, so `@rainbow-me/create-rainbowkit` templates have been upgraded to favor [viem](https://viem.sh/).

Give RainbowKit and [wagmi v1](https://wagmi.sh/react/migration-guide#1xx-breaking-changes) a try today:

```bash
yarn create @rainbow-me/rainbowkit
```
