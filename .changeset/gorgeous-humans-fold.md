'@rainbow-me/rainbowkit': patch
---

The new Wallet installation flows add two new colors to RainbowKit's `colors` property in the custom `theme` object: `downloadBottomCardBackground` and `downloadTopCardBackground`. Additionally, we now include the optional `iconAccent` prop in the `Wallet` object, specifically for wallets with both a browser extension and an app, to use as the accent color for the new download installation flows.
